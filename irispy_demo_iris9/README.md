How to Retrieve Files From This Repository
==========================================

If you are familiar with git and GitHub you can clone the repository.
If not, there is a green button on the upper right part of the webpage marked "Clone or Download".
Click on this button and a drop-down window will appear.
In the bottom right of this window is another button marked "Download As Zip".
Unpack, the zip file.
In a terminal change into the ``irispy_demo_iris9`` directory within the unzipped directory and enter:: console

    $ jupyter notebook irispy_demo_iris9.ipynb

If you do not have jupyter installed, you probably don't have anaconda either, the distribution of scientific Python packages on which IRISpy relies.
Go to http://docs.sunpy.org/projects/irispy/en/latest/installation.html to see how to install IRISpy.
This includes a link to the anaconda website to be installed first. (https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).
